# ios-clean.sh — full nuke-and-rebuild of the iOS native dependencies and
# Xcode caches. Run this when an iOS build fails with mysterious template
# errors, "works on my machine" weirdness, or after pulling Podfile changes.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Deintegrate CocoaPods (removes Pods/, Pods.xcodeproj entries)
#   2. Wipe ios/Pods, ios/Podfile.lock, ios/build
#   3. Wipe ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData (ALL projects, not just ours)
#   4. Reinstall Pods
#
# After this finishes, open Xcode → Product → Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K),
# then build.
#
# Drop this file at scripts/ios-clean.sh in your app's repo and add to
# your package.json scripts:
#   "ios:clean": "bash scripts/ios-clean.sh"
# Then invoke via:  npm run ios:clean
#
