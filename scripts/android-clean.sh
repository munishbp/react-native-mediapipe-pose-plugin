# android-clean.sh — full nuke-and-rebuild of the Android native build state.
# Run this when an Android build fails with mysterious Kotlin / CMake / dex
# errors, "works on my machine" weirdness, or after pulling gradle.properties
# / build.gradle changes and the incremental build starts behaving strangely.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Wipe android/.gradle          (per-project Gradle cache)
#   2. Wipe android/build            (top-level build outputs)
#   3. Wipe android/app/build        (app module build outputs)
#   4. Wipe android/app/.cxx         (C++ / CMake intermediate state)
#   5. Run ./gradlew clean           (triggers Gradle's own cleanup hooks)
#
# Does NOT touch:
#   - ~/.gradle (shared across all projects on this machine — nuking it
#     would re-download several GB of dependencies for unrelated projects)
#   - node_modules (use `npm install` for that)
#   - Any iOS file
#
# After this finishes, run:  npx expo run:android   (or: npm run android)
# Expect the next build to take several minutes longer than usual.
#
# Drop this file at scripts/android-clean.sh in your app's repo and add to
# your package.json scripts:
#   "android:clean": "bash scripts/android-clean.sh"
# Then invoke via:  npm run android:clean
#
